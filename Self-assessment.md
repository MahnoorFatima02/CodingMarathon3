   - Efficient handling of forms using controlled components
   - Signup and Login components showcase good practices in form submission and validation

5. **API Integration**

   - Proper integration with backend APIs using fetch
   - Correct handling of asynchronous operations with async/await syntax

6. **Authentication**

   - Authentication state managed and persisted using localStorage
   - Provides seamless user experience across page reloads
